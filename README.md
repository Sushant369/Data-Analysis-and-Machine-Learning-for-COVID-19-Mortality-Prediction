# Data Analysis and Machine Learning for COVID-19 Mortality Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that outlines our approach to predicting COVID-19 mortality using machine learning techniques. Our project employs exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression analysis to build a model that predicts COVID-19 outcomes with high accuracy.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of mortality in COVID-19 patients based on clinical and demographic data. By applying advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients and optimizing treatment strategies.

## Data Processing and Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized pandas, seaborn, and NumPy to examine the dataset, identifying trends, correlations, and distributions that inform feature engineering and model design.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed approximately 2500 outliers from the dataset to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
- **Feature Engineering**: Developed 10 new predictive features that improved model performance by 8%.

## Machine Learning Model

### Model Exploration and Selection
Initially, we explored a variety of machine learning models to ensure robust analysis and optimal outcomes. Our experiments included:

- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: While these provided insightful feature importance scores, they overfitted the data despite tuning efforts.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVMs performed well on smaller subsets of the data but struggled with scalability and computational efficiency on the full dataset.
- **Neural Networks**: We experimented with basic neural network architectures; however, they did not significantly outperform simpler models and required extensive computational resources.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like Gradient Boosting and Stacking were considered, but they did not provide a substantial improvement over simpler models in preliminary tests.

After extensive testing, we observed that simpler models not only performed comparably but also offered better interpretability and faster training times. Therefore, we chose to focus on refining a multiple regression model.

## Optimal Model: Multiple Regression
- **Implementation**: We implemented a multiple regression model that achieved approximately 90% accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality. This model was selected due to its robust performance across various metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Interpretability**: Multiple regression offered clear insights into how different variables influenced the prediction, which is crucial for medical data analysis.
- **Efficiency**: The model was computationally efficient, allowing for quicker iterations and scalability.

## Model Testing and Validation
Each of the proposed models would need to be rigorously tested and validated:
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure that our model generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize grid search or random search to find the optimal settings for each model.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate models based on appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the ROC-AUC curve, to ensure comprehensive performance assessment.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: seaborn, PowerBI
- **Machine Learning**: Sci-kit Learn for regression analysis
- **Reporting**: Integration of insights into PowerBI for enhanced data visualization and reporting.

## Model Improvement
- **Continuous Refinement**: We are continuously refining our model based on new data and feedback from deployment. This includes adjusting the model as new variables and data points become available.
- **Feedback Loop**: Implementing a feedback loop with frontline healthcare providers has helped in tuning the modelâ€™s practical implications and ensuring it meets clinical needs.

## Future Directions
- **Hybrid Models**: Considering a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of multiple regression with a non-linear model might address any remaining performance gaps.
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrating more diverse data sources could further enhance the model's predictive power and robustness.
